# Map pool sample configuration
#
# Each new rotation or voted pool should follow the same configuration structure, within this file
#
# NOTE: Map names are case-sensitive
#
# Record for the last active map pool on the server, so that it can be resumed upon shutdown/restart
last_active: default

pools:
  default:
    # Allowed types: ordered (rotation), voted (voted map pool)
    type: ordered
    enabled: true
    players: 1
    # next_map helps the server resume rotations in the position they were before a server shutdown/restart
    # and is only used for ordered map pools.
    # The next map for default is the first map in it's map list.
    # This only applies when the server creates the map-pools.yml file for the first time
    next_map: Airship Battle
    maps:
      - Airship Battle
