# Rotations sample configuration
#
# Each new rotation should follow the same configuration structure, within this file
#
# NOTE: Map names are case-sensitive
#
# Record for the last active rotation on the server, so that it can be resumed upon shutdown/restart
last_active: default

rotations:

    # next_map helps the server resume rotations in the position they were before a server shutdown/restart
    # The next map for default is the first map in it's map list.
    # This only applies when the server creates the rotations.yml file for the first time
