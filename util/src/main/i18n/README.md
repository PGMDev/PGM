Translations [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/pgm/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/pgm)
===

All languages that are [supported by the Minecraft client](https://crowdin.net/project/minecraft) are supported by PGM.

The original English string templates live in [strings.properties](templates/strings.properties), and may be edited
when making modifications to the project. Modifications to the English string templates will be automatically uploaded
to [our CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/pgm) when a new commit is pushed to the `master` branch or any
`feat/*` branch on the main PGM repo. Translations may then be submitted by the community. Once they are approved, they
will be automatically PR'd back into the source branch on an hourly basis.

**Note**: Please do not modify any *translation* files directly in this repo. Instead, translations should be submitted
through [our CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/pgm), through the process described above.
