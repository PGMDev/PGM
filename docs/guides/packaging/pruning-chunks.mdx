### 1. Download MCEdit

Start by downloading MCEdit from the [MCEdit website](http://mcedit.net/).
MCEdit is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
If you're having trouble running MCEdit you can [report an issue](https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit/wiki/Reporting-Issues).

`Note:` MCEdit is no longer being updated by codewarrior0 and is being continued by a small group over on [Khroki's Fork](https://github.com/Khroki/MCEdit-Unified/). There you can find updates for 1.8 and up.

### 2. Select the region around your map

Select a region that is just large enough to contain your entire map. Include at least a few blocks of empty space around the map. You can click "Select Chunks" to see exactly what will be included in the pruned map.
`Note:` Do not prune chunks inside the rectangle, as this will make the map difficult to work with. A few empty chunks will make no significant difference in map size.

### 3. Click "Chunk Control"

Click the Chunk Control button on the bottom right.

`Note:` You must be in "Chunk View" in order for this to work.`

### 4. Prune and save

Now you can prune the map by clicking the `Prune` button in the sidebar on the left. That’s it! Your map is now pruned. Save with `CTRL+S`, then you can close MCEdit. Be sure to remove any folders or files generated by MCEdit.
