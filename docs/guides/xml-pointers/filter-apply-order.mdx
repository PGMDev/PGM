title: Filter Apply Order
---

After proto `1.3.3` and above, the order that you [apply](/modules/regions#applying) filters to regions affects their behavior.
Here's an example.

Let's start out with a basic filter that **denies** everything **except** TNT.

```xml
<filter name="only-tnt">
    <block>tnt</block>
</filter>
```

Now let's apply this filter to `Region A`, and also apply a filter to `Region B` that denies all blocks.

```xml
<apply block="only-tnt" region="region-a"/>

<apply block="never" region="region-b"/>
```

However, there is one slight complication. `Region B` is inside of `Region A`.
So which filter will override the other? This is where the apply order comes in handy.

The order that you put the `<apply>`'s can change the outcome when something gets filtered.
In the previous example, the `only-tnt` filter would always override the `never` filter since it is above it.
The apply for `region B` won't get checked since it overlaps completely with `region A` and `region A` never returns abstain.

If we changed the order of the filters:

```xml
<apply block="never" region="region-b"/>
<apply block="only-tnt" region="region-a"/>
```

Now you cannot place blocks in `Region B`, but outside of it in `Region A` you can only place TNT blocks.

Although this may not be an issue for many maps such as a Blitz map or a TDM,
this is a crucial concept for many DTC/DTM/CTW maps that use the `<void/>` filter.
Usually it's best to have the `<void/>` filter at the lowest priority (at the bottom of the list).

A map developer will be able to help you through this process to ensure that your map's regions and filters are properly working.
