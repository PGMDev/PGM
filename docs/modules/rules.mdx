You can use the rules module to add custom rules to your map that are not already included within your own established server-wide rules. Regions and filters should be used to enforce access and block rules.

<div class="table-container">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Rule Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Value/Children</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>{`<rules> </rules>`}</label>
        </td>
        <td>Node containing all the defined custom rules.</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Sub-elements</th>
        <th />
        <th />
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>{`<rule> </rule>`}</label>
        </td>
        <td>A custom map rule.</td>
        <td>
          <span class="badge badge--primary">Text</span>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
