### Ghost Squadron

Enables the ghostsquadron gamemode and all its features.
The default ghostsquadron classes can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OvercastNetwork/maps.oc.tc/master/Blitz/GS/gs.xml).
Ghost squadron maps set a custom gamemode title in the `gs.xml` with the `<map game="Ghost Squadron">` attribute.
When not using the default GS XML include a custom title should be set.

`NOTE:` This module must be used in conjunction with another gamemode.

```xml
<ghostsquadron />
<include src="gs.xml" />

<time>6m</time>
<blitz>
    <broadcastLives>false</broadcastLives>
</blitz>
```

### Rage

Enable the one hit kill, rage style gamemode.

One hit kills will only be applied to items that have a sharpness enchantment greater than level 1. One shot arrow kills will only be applied to bows that have a power enchantment greater than level 1.

`NOTE:` This module must be used in conjunction with another gamemode.

```xml
<rage/>

<time>8m</time>
<score>
    <limit>15</limit>
</score>
```

### Team Death-match

This gamemode uses the [scoring](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring) module to run the game for a specified amount of time, after which the team with the highest score wins. Teams increase their score by killing players from the other team or capturing points from a [score box](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring#score_box).

`NOTE:` To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.

```xml
<score>
    <kills>1</kills>    <!-- +1 points for a kill -->
    <deaths>1</deaths>  <!-- -1 points for dying -->
</score>

<!-- Time till the match ends in seconds (10 minutes) -->
<time>600</time>
```

### Free-For-All

The FFA gamemode uses the [players](/docs/modules/format/players) instead of the [teams](/docs/modules/format/teams) module to create a team-less match.
Depending on the modules used, players can increase their score by killing other players until a score or time limit is reached or by capturing objectives, etc.

`NOTE:` To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.

```xml
<players max="16" max-overfill="20"/>
<time>8m</time>

<score>
    <kills>1</kills>
    <deaths>1</deaths>
</score>
```
