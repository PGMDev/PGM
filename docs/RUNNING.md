Running a Server
================

Now that you've read about the project, it's time to set up a server to play with your friends! We'll walk through the "traditional" way of running a PGM server, similar to how you would run a Bukkit server. If you want to learn more about running servers, please see some additional documentation [here.](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/)

Installation
------------

Refer to the [installation guide](https://pgm.dev/docs/guides/preparing/local-server-setup/) for instructions on how to set up a PGM server.
